    "  * this is both a good and a bad\n",
    "* It's...\n",
    "  * old (1991)\n",
    "  * Guido van Rossum used to be the BDFL\n",

    "  * it's a terrible language for numerics\n",
    "* containers vs. simple variables\n",
    "  * containers: str\n",

    "  * mutable:\n",
    "* Python practices \"truthiness\"\n",
    "  * we are allowed to use non-Boolean expressions in a Boolean context\n",
    "    * 0 and 0.0 are considered False\n",
    "    * non-zero numbers are considered True\n",

    "* when coding a problem, introspect into your brain to understand how YOU solve the problem, but...\n",
    "  * sometimes you skip a step in your brain that Python can't skip\n",
    "  * corollary: you often combine steps or perform operations that are difficult to enumerate\n",
