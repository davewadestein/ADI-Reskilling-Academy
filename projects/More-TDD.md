# Even more TDD after you've written some function (after you've written the tests first)
* either write the RPN Calculator (described in this folder)
  * determine what functions you think you will need (not writing code)
  * write tests for those functions (not writing code except for the tests)
  * write you algorithm for the program (intertwined with above)
  * now write code to get the tests (which were failing before) to pass
* or Hangman
  * grab a word at random from wordlist.txt in the materials
    * (I would start with one or two words for testing purposes)
  * display the same number of "blanks" as the length of the word, e.g., - - - - -
  * user should guess a letter or the whole word
  * after some number of guesses, e.g., 5 or 7, or user input, they lose
* or take a program we already wrote (e.g., Cows & Bulls, Chutes & Ladders)
  * do TDD on this...
