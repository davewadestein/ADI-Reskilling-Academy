# Even more TDD after you've written some function (after you've written the tests first)
* either write the RPN Calculator (described in this folder)
  * determine what functions you think you will need (not writing code)
  * write tests for those functions (not writing code except for the tests)
  * write you algorithm for the program (intertwined with above)
  * now write code to get the tests (which were failing before) to pass
* or take a program we already wrote (e.g., Cows & Bulls, Chutes & Ladders)
  * do TDD on this...
